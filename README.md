# 401 ASP.NET Core Curriculum Overview

The ASP.NET curriculum is broken up into three main modules:

1. Intro to C#
1. ASP.NET Web Development
1. E-Commerce Project

## Module 1 - Into to C #

This module consists of introduction to C#. You will spend the next 10 classes
teaching the students C# and getting them ready to go into ASP.NET Core web development. ASP.NET Core assumes
an intermediate knowledge of C#, so we have 10 classes to get the students to that level. The focus
on these 2 weeks is primarily computer-science related and does not work with the web. The lab assignments are all
console apps and focus on practicing the c# concepts taught daily.

## Module 3: E-Commerce Project

The second half of the class focuses on one major project. The students
and a partner work together to build out an E-Commerce store. The second half
is broken up into (3) 1-week sprints. Each week is broken into daily milestones.
Each milestone consists of 3-5 user stories that are divided amongst all developers
in a team.

Each day, the developers will complete their respective user stories. Each day builds
off the prior, so it is important that all user stories from one day is completed
before the next.

*Projects are only submitted at the end of each sprint* - This allows for
students to progress towards an "end of week sprint" goal instead of feeling rushed
everyday to complete the given tasks. This is also intentional to emulate a real-world
team where in an agile environment, they are given until the end of the sprint to complete all the
tasks that are assigned to them each day.

Students will use Azure Dev Ops (ADO) as their project management tool and Azure Repos as their source control. They will
use the ADO kanban board to create and manage user stories.
