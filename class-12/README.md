## NOTES

### Entity Framework

1. What is Entity Framework?
1. Why do we use it?

EF Core can serve as an object-relational mapper (O/RM), enabling .NET developers to work with a database using .NET objects, and eliminating the need for most of the data-access code they usually need to write.

EFCore allows us to make calls and queries to our database through this ORM allowing for efficiency and ease of use.
