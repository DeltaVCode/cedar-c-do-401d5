## Vision

What pain point does this project solve?

Why should we care about your product?

## Scope (In/Out)
- IN - What will your product do
    - Describe the individual features that your product will do. 
	- High overview of each. Only need to list 4-5
	- Example:
		- The web app will provide information to the users about all the different Cat Cafe's in the area
		- The web app will provide both walking and driving directions to each of the destinations
		- Users will be able to "Star" their favorite shops. 
		- Each shop will contain reviews of the customer's experiences
- OUT - What will your product not do. 
  - These should be features that you will make 
very clear from the beginning that you will not do during development.
