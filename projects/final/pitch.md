# General Project Description

For your final project, you will be summarizing all of the concepts you've 
learned and applied in labs and projects throughout the whole course. 

At this point, you should have an idea as to what's possible to create 
given some research you've conducted on the .NET Core framework as a whole. 

## Ideas
Think up ideas of what you want to create. This can be anything within the .NET realm. Here are a a few **suggestions**:
1. [Azure Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/)
	- [Azure Bot Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/bot-service/)
	- [AWS Chatbot](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-lex-net-chatbot)
	- [AWS Tutorial](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/bots-just-got-better-net-toolkit-lex-lambda-cognito/)
1. [Signal R](http://signalr.net/)
	- [MSFT Docs](https://www.asp.net/signalr)
	- [GH repo](https://github.com/SignalR/SignalR/wiki)
1. [.NET Core Blazor](https://blazor.net/docs/tutorials/build-your-first-blazor-app.html)
	- [.NET Curry Blazor](https://www.dotnetcurry.com/dotnet/1460/blazor-getting-started)


Take a look at ASP.NET as a whole. Pick a project that solves a problem, or something that just "sounds cool". Have fun, experiment, and learn something new!

## Group Project: Pitch Ideas
It is now time to begin preparations for your Group Project. 
You've been given groups, so the first step for group projects is to pitch ideas.

## Tasks
As a group, arrange a 30-60 minute time when you can all be in the same place. 
Lab time is ideal for this.

There will be two phases for this:

## Brainstorming Ideas
Pitching a Project
Brainstorm Ideas
Grab a white board and brainstorm ideas. During this phase, there is no comment or criticism of ideas. Ideas should be given in the form of titles or very short phrases. If an explanation is needed, save it for the pitch round.

## Pitching a Project
Once a critical mass of ideas has been written down, 
the person who offered the idea will give a pitch. Each pitch may be no longer than 2 to 3 minutes. The purpose of a pitch is to sell the idea to your group mates. During this phase, questions may be asked, but the discussion should be limited. Keep it short and to the point.

At the end of the pitch, you should have formed a short list of favorites.


## Submitting your work
**Only one person needs to submit this assignment for the group to receive credit**
As a group, agree on 2 top ideas. In a doc, or in the text area below outline 
The following for each idea. The instructional staff will then approve one of your two ideas.
Please have your top choice listed first, and second choice listed last. 

<u>Name of Project</u>
1. What problem or pain point does it solve?
   a. Keep it high level without going into too much detail. 
1. Why is it interesting?
1. Minimum MVP defined.
