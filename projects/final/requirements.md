# Final Project - Week 10

Welcome to your Final Project!! 

## Requirements

The requirements for your final project is to think up something cool, new, and fun.
Challenge yourself to venture into a technology that you are not familiar with within .NET Core that
you want to learn more about. 

This is a great opportunity for you to apply your "learn to learn" skills you
have acquired and practiced the past 20 weeks to use by creating a project, 
or a small part of a project that focuses on something that will challenge
and help you grow as a developer. 

Not in the mood to venture into a new technology? Stay in the ASP.NET realm,
take a look at the different external APIs out there and 3rd party services
and build a website around them. Solve a problem. Build a game. Have fun.
