# Group Project: Begin Wireframes & Software Requirements

## User Stories
User stories are extremely important. it gives us, as developers, guidance about what
tasks we should be working on and allows us to visually see what our client wants. 

Follow the User story requirements found [HERE](../UserStories){:target="_blank"}


## Wireframes
It is now time to begin preparations for your Group Project. 
The next step for group projects is to begin to generate wireframes for 
each page in your application.

### Tasks
Wireframes allow you to experiment with the look and feel of a website 
without committing any code. You can use an online or desktop tool, such 
as Moqups.com or Mockingbird. Create your Wireframe in a digital tool.

Provide an image of your wireframes in with the readme of your project.

## Requirements
Create a markdown file in your project repo that defines your 
project's software requirements.

Name your doc `Requirements.md` and be sure to include all of the required information, in detail. 

The requirements for your software requirements doc can be found [HERE](../SoftwareReqs){:target="_blank"} 

Inside your Class Repository, in the Resources Folder, lives 2 "official" Software Requirements docs. You 
are not required to create a multipage doc, just one page is enough, but should you want example and inspiration, they are there 
for your reference.

## Database Schema
Draft out what your database will look like by creating a schema. 
Be sure to identify which tables are:

1. 1-to-1 relationships
1. 1-to-many relationships
1. many-to-many relationships

Also, include in each table:
1. The name of column
1. The required data type

Include this DB schema in your readme, accompanied by an explanation of each table
and it's responsibility in the application. 

#### Submitting Your Work
**This is a group submission. Only one person must submit for 
group credit**

Submit your project repo with your readme outlined.
