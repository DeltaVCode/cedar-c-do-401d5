# Midterm Final Outcome and Presentation

Each group will have a set period of time between 10 and 20 minutes to show their work. Each team member should speak during the presentation. You will want to talk about what your project does, and how it works. You should talk about the technical and personal challenges you faced and conquered during project week.


Your presentation should show your work in the best possible light. Try to keep it engaging and fast-paced. Do not get too bogged down in technical details, instead focus on a high-level overview of the project. Slides are not required, but you must show the result of your project running on a remote server.

Both of your final midterm GitHub projects should contain the following:

## Source Code
This is the code of your project. Include the .sln file and source folders

Your project that is created should follow all of the required guidelines described 
[HERE](ProjReqs.md){:target="_blank"} 

## Tests
Tests are important. Write tests that cover basic getters/setters of your models, as well as CRUD operations within your functionality. 


## ReadMe
Both your web app and API should contain a readme with the following information:
1. Link to your deployed site
1. Introduction to your project (What is it? Why should you use it? What is it's purpose?)
1. Screenshots of what your project looks like
1. If an API, data examples of how to setup/use (in addition, link to the api/swagger documentation)
1. Database Schema (clean digital drawing)
1. WireFrames. 
1. DB Schema breakdown/explanation
1. Tools you used (VSTS, Visual Studio, Swagger, etc...)
1. Contributors
1. MIT License

## Software Requirements Doc
1. The Software Reqs doc can live in the Web App Repo. 
This should be the same reqs doc that you completed for your midterm prework. 
This should be named `Requirements.md`

## Documentation (API Only)
You may need additional documentation for your API. 
The API Team should have ***clear and concise*** documenation on the API endpoints. This should 
contain information such as 

1. Name of the endpoint/route
1. Possible accepted data
1. Examples and code snippets of requests/responses

Here are some options:
1. Use [Swagger](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/web-api-help-pages-using-swagger?view=aspnetcore-2.1){:target="_blank"}  (strongly preferred)
1. Create your custom documentation
