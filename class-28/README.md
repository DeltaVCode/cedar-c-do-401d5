# Authentication, Authorization, Cookies

When working directly with APIs we used a "Bearer Token" with http headers to allow a "logged in" user to access resources based on their identity, claim, and policy using Roles.

In a web application, the same process must still exist, but the mechanism changes from using a Bearer Token + Header combination and instead relies on **HTTP Cookies**
