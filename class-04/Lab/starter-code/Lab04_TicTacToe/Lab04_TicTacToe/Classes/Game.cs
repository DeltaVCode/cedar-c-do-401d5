            /*
             * Complete this method by constructing the logic for the actual playing of Tic Tac Toe. 
             * 
             * A few things to get you started:
            1. A turn consists of a player picking a position on the board with their designated marker. 
            2. Display the board after every turn to show the most up to date state of the game
            3. Once a Winner is determined, display the board one final time and return a winner

            Few additional hints:
                Be sure to keep track of the number of turns that have been taken to determine if a draw is required
                and make sure that the game continues while there are unmarked spots on the board. 

            Use any and all pre-existing methods in this program to help construct the method logic.
