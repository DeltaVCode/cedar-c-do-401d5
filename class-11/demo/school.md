# Compose an ERD

This week, we will be building out a student enrollment system
in class. Here is our problem domain:

You have been tasked to create a system for a new coding school
in your neighborhood. While gathering requirements,
you were able to learn how the school plans on managing their
enrollment. Here is what you gathered:

The coding school will gather information from each student.

Their system requires the student's first name, last name and birth date.

Each course that the coding school will offer has a Name, specific course code, and the price that the course will cost.

In addition, each course will be associated with a specific technology, the options for the technology are predetermined dependent on the stacks being taught.

A student can be enrolled in multiple courses and once a student has completed a course, their final grade and if they passed is captured in a single transcript.

A student can have many transcripts associated with them. It is also safe to say that once a course is completed, the system will generate a transcript for every student that was present in the course.

The transcript should independently store the student's information,
course information, The grade they received, and if they passed or not.

Using the information you received above, create a database ERD that will accurately represent the data that will be held and accessed for this student enrollment system for the school.
