## Lecture Outline

### Unit Testing

- Test Driven Development
- Red/Green/Refactor
- Facts
  - Always true
- Theories
  - Conditionally True
- Why is it important?
  1. Confidently refactor, make it agile
  1. High Quality Code
  1. Documentation
  1. Assists in Debugging
  1. Reduce company cost

### Demo

- Build/add a testing solution
  - Add a new project
  - Don't forget to add the reference
- Build out app with TDD
  - Test First, Code Last. Follow the R/G/R approach
- Show code coverage
  - How much of our code has been tested? Can we aim for 90%?
  - What are the benefits of code coverage?

### Documentation

- Why do we need it
- Readme's <-- What are they?
- Proper Structure

### Example Readme

- [Sample Readme]("/sample-README.md")
