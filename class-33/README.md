# IEmailSender/Sendgrid

One of the more basic functions web applications must adopt is the ability to send emails to users, or allow users to email the site owners (for example, a "Contact Us" form)

Traditionally, servicing emails is very hard to setup on the server side, but many providers, such as **Sendgrid** have made this process far less painful for software developers to plug into with easy to use SDKs

### Sendgrid

1. What are email servers?
2. What do they do?
3. How/Why do we use them?
4. What is SendGrid?

Sendgrid is used as an email service for many sites. This allows us to send emails from our web app. ASP.NET Core can successfully do this through installing the right NuGet package of SendGrid and setting up some basic code send out an email:

```csharp
SendGridClient client = new SendGridClient(Configuration["SendGridKey"]);
SendGridMessage msg = new SendGridMessage();

msg.SetFrom("admin@cfblogposts.com", "Blog Admin");
msg.AddTo(email);
msg.SetSubject(subject);
msg.AddContent(MimeType.Html, htmlMessage);

await client.SendEmailAsync(msg);
```
