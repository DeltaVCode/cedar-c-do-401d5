# LINQ?

Language Integrated Query

- Imperative vs Declarative
  - What is Imperative
    - Foreach Loop
  - What is Declarative
    - LINQ statement

  - What is a 'query'?
  - A query is an expression that, when enumerated, transforms sequences with query operators.
  - The standard query operators are implemented as *extension methods*, so we can call 'Where' directly onto names

ALL LINQ query operations consist of three distinct actions:

1. Obtain the data source
1. Create the query
1. Execute the query

## Deferred Execution

The query variable that holds the query command doesn't actually execute until you iterate over it. An example would be a foreach loop.

The variable does not hold the result, only the command. So you can keep iterating over it and potentially get different answers.
