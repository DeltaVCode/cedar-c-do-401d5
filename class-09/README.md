# Class 09: LINQ & Delegates

## Learning Objectives

1. Students will be able to successfully write LINQ queries against a collection to extract data.
1. Students will understand the use of a Lambda statement and how to join them with LINQ queries.

## Lecture Outline

1. Review Collections
1. Create a collection
   - Add data to the collection
   - Iterate through the collection
1. What is an easier way to iterate through a collection?

### What Is LINQ?

- Language Integrated Query

1. Imperative vs Declarative
   - What is Imperative
      - Foreach Loop
   - What is Declarative
      - LINQ statement

1. What is a 'query'?
   - A query is an expression that, when enumerated, transforms sequences with query operators.
   - The standard query operators are implemented as *extension methods*, so we can call 'WHERE' directly onto names.

### Query Expressions

```csharp
string[] names = { "Tom", "Dick", "Harry" };

IEnumerable<string> filteredNames = from n in names
                                    where n.Contains("a")
                                    select n;

IEnumerable<string> filteredNames = System.Linq.Enumerable.Where(names, n => n.Length >= 4);

foreach (string n in filteredNames){Console.WriteLine (n);}
```

### Lambda Statements

```csharp
n => n.Length >= 4
```

```csharp
IEnumerable<string> filtered = names.Where(n => n.Contains("a"));
IEnumerable<string> sorted = filtered.OrderBy(n => n.Length);
IEnumerable<string> finalQuery = sorted.Select(n => n.ToUpper());


foreach (string name in filtered)
    Console.Write (name + "|");        // Harry|Mary|Jay|

Console.WriteLine();
foreach (string name in sorted)
    Console.Write (name + "|");        // Jay|Mary|Harry|

Console.WriteLine();
foreach (string name in finalQuery)
    Console.Write (name + "|");        // JAY|MARY|HARRY|

```

### Anonymous Types & Anonymous Objects

An anonymous type is specified through a `var` type:

```csharp
    var filteredNames = names.Where (n => n.Length >= 4);
```

An anonymous object is an object that is a "modified" object that is the result from a LINQ search:

```csharp
var bookAuthorCollection = from b in books
                           select new {
                             Book: b,
                             Author: b.Authors[0]
                           };

foreach (var x in bookAuthorCollection)
    Console.WriteLine("Book title - {0}, First author {1}", x.Book.Title, x.Author.FirstName);
```
