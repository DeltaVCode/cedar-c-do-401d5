# Interfaces

Interfaces tell a class what it can do. This means that when you visually see an interface **implemented** onto a class, that means that the class you are looking at has an obligation to fulfill the requirements listed in the interface.

The obligation that the class has extends out to all of the properties and methods that the interface defines.

When implementing an interface, the class must, no exceptions, implement each of those items defined in the interface. If you choose not too...the compiler will error and you will be unable to continue.

## Why use an interface?

Interfaces are traditionally used on more than one class, or better yet, have the ability to be used on more than one class. Interfaces tell a class what it can do, versus inheritance, which tells a class what it has.

Traditionally, you use interfaces to allow functionality on a class on external components that depend on the methods being called within the interface.

Most commonly, in the development world, when working across teams, your team will receive an interface that must be implemented in your code.

The interface defines what exactly this other team is expecting, and it is your job to define the functionality for each of those methods and properties.

Why do you need them?

- Sometimes you need to group your objects together based on the **things they can do** rather than the classes they inherit from.
- That is where interfaces come in - they let you work with any class that can do the job.
- Any class that implements an interface must promise to 'fulfill it's obligations' or the compiler will get upset.
- Think of interfaces like 'actions' or 'protocols' that can be implemented on other classes

Thinking back to the OOP principles, Polymorphism helps us utilize and understand interfaces a bit more. When we *implement* an interface onto a class, we are allowing any future functionality that requires that interface to accept the class, or its descendants to be used. With polymorphism, the class we have just implemented the interface on is now a specific "type" and we can treat it accordingly.

## Interface References

1. You can't instantiate an interface, but you can **reference** an interface

- This is not allowed:

```csharp
 ICatAttack kitcat = new ICatAttack();
```

This *is* allowed:

```csharp
 KittyCat kitty = new KittyCat();
    ICatAttack kitcat = kitty;
```

- A new reference is created using the variable ICatAttack.
- This reference can point to an instance of **any class that implements ICatAttack**

1. You can create a new object and assign it straight to an interface reference variable:

```csharp
 IKittyCat = kitcat = new Kitty();
```

1. "is" Keyword can determine if a specific class implements an interface

```csharp

if(x is Kitty)
{
//Logic here
};

```

### Interface Properties

- An interface is like an abstract base class with abstract methods, but is not. Any class or struct that implements the interface must implement all its members.
- An interface can't be instantiated directly. Its members are implemented by any class or struct that implements the interface.
- Interfaces can contain events, indexers, methods, and properties.
- Interfaces contain no implementation of methods.
- A class or struct can implement multiple interfaces. A class can inherit a base class and also implement one or more interfaces.

### Overview

Let's dive into an example that may show interfaces a bit more clearly.

Imagine you have an application that creates automobiles. You structure your program so that it has an abstract Automobile class with a derived class of `Car`.

Imagine you also have a `Person` class. This `Person` class has the ability to do a lot of different actions such as walking, talking, and driving.

Because driving is really just a general action we don't/shouldn't have specific methods in the `Person` class that instructs them how to drive, instead we should just have a method/action that takes in a parameter requiring something that is drivable.

We accomplish this by creating an interface named `IDrive`. This specific interface will include methods such as `Start()`, `Brake()`, `Stop()` etc...

We will require any class that implements `IDrive` to include this functionality so that when a Person wants to drive a car, they can just call the Car.Start() method to start the automobile.

The person no longer has to guess if the automobile they are trying to drive has the correct functionality. It can be assumed that it has exactly what it needs to because of the obligation and contract that interfaces have with the classes they are implemented into.

The alternative to this is to force the person have a specific DriveCar method that takes in (Car Car), which means if we have a boat that is drivable, we would have to create another method that is called DriveBoat that takes in a (Boat boat).
