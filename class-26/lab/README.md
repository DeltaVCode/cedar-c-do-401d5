# E-commerce Sprint 1 - Milestone 1:  MVC

Work together with your partner(s) to complete this lab.

> NOTE: Your team workflow will live in Azure Dev Ops. Use this tool to store your project repository code, user stories, and general overall workflow. [Azure DevOps CheatSheet](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-dotnet-guide/curriculum/projects/ecommerce/azure-devops-cheatsheet)

Your team will be evaluated and graded at the end of every sprint for the individual milestones and overall presentation of the sprint/project. Each day the previous day's milestones build off each other as the project progresses. Stay on top of your work, **Communicate**, and work together.

## Admin Dashboard

Create the general Administrative Dashboard workflow, User Interface/Design, screens, and initial database design and wiring.

### User Stories and Tasks

Divide your work evenly amongst your team members.

1. As an admin user, I would like to view a detail page for each category so that I can eventually edit its data or delete it
1. As an admin user, I would like to see a list of the products assigned to a category on the category details page
1. As an admin user, I would like a detail page for each product so that I can eventually edit its data or delete it

- Configure your core:  `DbContext` with seed data, Interfaces/Services, Routing
